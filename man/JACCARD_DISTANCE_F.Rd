\title{Retrieve Jaccard Distance Matrix for Robust Stratifications}
\usage{
JACCARD_DISTANCE_F(Object)
}
\arguments{
\item{Object}{A processed \code{\link{ClustAllObject-class}} object. The object
must have been processed by \code{\link{runClustAll}} before using this method.}
}
\value{
A square matrix where each element represents the Jaccard distance
between two robust stratifications. The row and column names correspond to
the names of the robust stratifications. Returns NULL if \code{\link{runClustAll}}
has not been executed on the object.
}
\description{
This method extracts and returns the matrix of Jaccard distances between
robust stratifications identified by the ClustALL algorithm. It provides a
quantitative measure of similarity between different clustering solutions
that have passed the bootstrapping process for population-based robustness.
}
\details{
The JACCARD_DISTANCE_F method provides crucial information about the similarity
structure of robust clustering solutions:

1. Jaccard Distance:
   - A measure of dissimilarity between sample sets, calculated as 1 minus the Jaccard coefficient.
   - Ranges from 0 (identical stratifications) to 1 (completely different stratifications).
   - Lower values indicate higher similarity between stratifications.

2. Matrix Structure:
   - Symmetric matrix with stratification names as row and column labels.
   - Diagonal elements are always 0 (each stratification is identical to itself).
   - Off-diagonal elements represent pairwise Jaccard distances.

3. Robust Stratifications:
   - Only includes stratifications that passed the bootstrapping process.
   - Represents the most stable and reliable clustering solutions.

This method is particularly useful for:
- Identifying groups of similar stratifications.
- Assessing the diversity of robust clustering solutions.
- Selecting representative stratifications for further analysis.
- Visualizing the relationships between different clustering outcomes.
- Input for further clustering or dimensionality reduction of stratifications.
}
\note{
- This method returns the data stored in the 'JACCARD_DISTANCE_F' slot of the ClustAllObject.
- It will return NULL if \code{\link{runClustAll}} has not been executed on the object.
- The Jaccard distance is calculated based on the co-occurrence of samples in clusters,
  not on the specific cluster labels.
- This matrix is often used as input for the \code{\link{plotJACCARD}} function
  to visualize the similarity structure of stratifications.
