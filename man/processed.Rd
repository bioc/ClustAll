\title{Check Processing Status of ClustAllObject}
\usage{
processed(Object)
}
\arguments{
\item{Object}{A \code{\link{ClustAllObject-class}} object created by
\code{\link{createClustAll}}.}
}
\value{
A logical value:
\itemize{
  \item TRUE if \code{\link{runClustAll}} has been executed on the object.
  \item FALSE if the object has not yet been processed by \code{\link{runClustAll}}.
}
}
\description{
This method retrieves the processing status of a ClustAllObject, indicating
whether the ClustALL algorithm has been executed on the object. It provides a
quick way to verify if clustering results are available for analysis.
}
\details{
The processed method serves as a crucial indicator in the ClustALL workflow:

1. Processing Status:
   - Indicates whether the ClustALL algorithm has been applied to the object.
   - A TRUE value means clustering results are available for analysis.
   - A FALSE value indicates the object only contains input data and preprocessing.

2. Workflow Implications:
   - Helps determine which methods and analyses can be performed on the object.
   - Guides users in the correct sequence of operations in the ClustALL pipeline.

3. Data Availability:
   - TRUE status implies availability of:
     * Stratification results (\code{\link{summary_clusters}})
     * Jaccard distance matrix (\code{\link{JACCARD_DISTANCE_F}})
     * Other clustering-related outputs
   - FALSE status means only input and preprocessed data are available.
}
\note{
- This method checks the 'processed' slot of the ClustAllObject.
- The processed status is automatically set to TRUE when \code{\link{runClustAll}}
  completes successfully.
- Users should not manually modify this status to ensure consistency between
  the status and the actual content of the object.
- A FALSE status does not necessarily indicate an error; it simply means
  \code{\link{runClustAll}} needs to be executed before accessing clustering results.
