\title{Retrieve Imputed Data from ClustAllObject}
\usage{
dataImputed(Object)
}
\arguments{
\item{Object}{A \code{\link{ClustAllObject-class}} object created by
\code{\link{createClustAll}}.}
}
\value{
A 'mids' object from the mice package containing the imputed datasets.
If no imputation was performed, the method returns NULL.
}
\description{
This method extracts and returns the imputed datasets stored in a ClustAllObject.
It provides access to the multiple imputed versions of the data generated to
handle missing values, if imputation was performed during the object creation
or processing.
}
\details{
The dataImputed method provides access to the imputed data used in the ClustALL
analysis pipeline when missing values are present. Key aspects of this data include:

1. Imputation Structure:
   - Returns a 'mids' object, which contains multiple imputed datasets.
   - Each imputed dataset is a complete version of the original data with
     missing values filled in.
   - The number of imputed datasets corresponds to the 'nImputation' parameter
     used during object creation.

2. Imputation Method:
   - Imputation is performed using the mice (Multivariate Imputation by Chained
     Equations) package.
   - The specific imputation methods used for each variable can be examined
     in the returned 'mids' object.

3. Data Consistency:
   - The imputed datasets maintain the same structure (rows and columns) as
     the original data.
   - Only variables with missing values are imputed; complete variables remain unchanged.
