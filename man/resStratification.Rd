\title{Extract Representative Stratifications from ClustAllObject}
\usage{
resStratification(Object, population = 0.05, all = FALSE,
                         stratification_similarity = 0.7)
}
\arguments{
\item{Object}{A processed \code{\link{ClustAllObject-class}} object. The object
must have been processed by \code{\link{runClustAll}} before using this function.}

\item{population}{Numeric value between 0 and 1. Specifies the minimum
proportion of the total population that a cluster within a stratification must
contain to be considered valid. Default is 0.05.}

\item{all}{Logical. If TRUE, returns all stratifications meeting the criteria
for each group of similar stratifications. If FALSE (default), returns only
the centroid (most representative) stratification for each group.}

\item{stratification_similarity}{Numeric value between 0 and 1. Sets the
threshold Jaccard distance for considering two stratifications as similar.
Default is 0.7. Higher values result in more stringent similarity criteria.}
}
\value{
A list of representative stratifications and their associated clusters.
The structure of the return value depends on the 'all' parameter:
- If all = FALSE: A named list where each element represents the centroid
  stratification for a group of similar stratifications.
- If all = TRUE: A nested list where each top-level element represents a group
  of similar stratifications, and contains all stratifications in that group.
Each stratification is represented by a table showing the distribution of
patients across clusters.
}
\description{
This function retrieves and filters representative stratifications from a
processed ClustAllObject. It allows users to explore the most robust and
significant clustering solutions generated by the ClustALL algorithm, based
on population size criteria and stratification similarity.
}
\details{
The resStratification function performs several key steps:

1. Filters stratifications based on the 'population' parameter, ensuring that
   each cluster in a stratification contains at least the specified proportion
   of the total population.
2. Groups similar stratifications based on their Jaccard distances, using the
   'stratification_similarity' threshold.
3. For each group of similar stratifications:
   - If all = FALSE, selects the centroid (most representative) stratification.
   - If all = TRUE, includes all stratifications in the group.

This function is particularly useful for:
- Identifying the most robust and significant clustering solutions.
- Reducing the number of stratifications to a manageable set for further analysis.
- Exploring how different similarity thresholds affect the grouping of stratifications.
- Comparing multiple similar stratifications within each group (when all = TRUE).
}
\note{
- This function requires a processed ClustAllObject. Ensure
\code{\link{runClustAll}}
  has been executed before using resStratification.
- The 'population' parameter helps filter out stratifications with very small,
  potentially insignificant clusters.
- The 'stratification_similarity' parameter allows for fine-tuning the balance
  between diversity and similarity in the returned stratifications.
- When exploring results, it's often useful to try different combinations of
  'population' and 'stratification_similarity' values to understand the
  characteristics of your clustering solutions.
