\title{Retrieve Summary of Clustering Results from ClustAllObject}
\usage{
summary_clusters(Object)
}
\arguments{
\item{Object}{A processed \code{\link{ClustAllObject-class}} object. The object
must have been processed by \code{\link{runClustAll}} before using this method.}
}
\value{
A list where each element represents a stratification. Each stratification
is a vector of cluster assignments for each sample in the dataset. Returns NULL
if \code{\link{runClustAll}} has not been executed on the object.
}
\description{
This method extracts and returns a comprehensive summary of all clustering
results (stratifications) generated by the ClustALL algorithm. It provides
access to the complete set of clustering solutions, including both robust
and non-robust stratifications.
}
\details{
The summary_clusters method provides access to all clustering results generated
during the ClustALL analysis:

1. Comprehensive Results:
   - Includes all stratifications generated, regardless of their robustness.
   - Each stratification represents a unique combination of data embedding,
     distance metric, clustering algorithm, and number of clusters.

2. Stratification Structure:
   - Each element in the returned list is named according to the parameters
     used to generate it (e.g., "cuts_a_1" for the first cut using method 'a').
   - Each stratification is a vector of integers, where each integer represents
     a cluster assignment for a sample.

3. Analysis Possibilities:
   - Allows for comparison of different clustering solutions.
   - Enables examination of how different algorithm parameters affect clustering outcomes.
   - Facilitates identification of consistent patterns across multiple stratifications.

This method is particularly useful for:
- Accessing the full range of clustering solutions for in-depth analysis.
- Comparing robust stratifications (identified by other methods) with the full set of results.
- Extracting specific stratifications for further analysis or visualization.
}
\note{
- This method returns the data stored in the 'summary_clusters' slot of the ClustAllObject.
- It will return NULL if \code{\link{runClustAll}} has not been executed on the object.
- The returned list includes all stratifications, not just those deemed robust.
  For accessing only robust stratifications, consider using the \code{\link{resStratification}} function.
- The order and naming of stratifications in the returned list correspond to
  the order in which they were generated during the ClustALL process.
