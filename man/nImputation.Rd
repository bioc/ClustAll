\title{Retrieve Number of Imputations from ClustAllObject}
\usage{
nImputation(Object)
}
\arguments{
\item{Object}{A \code{\link{ClustAllObject-class}} object created by
\code{\link{createClustAll}}.}
}
\value{
An integer indicating the number of imputations performed. Returns 0
if no imputations were required or performed.
}
\description{
This method returns the number of imputations performed when creating or
processing the ClustAllObject. It provides information about how missing data
was handled in the ClustALL pipeline.
}
\details{
The nImputation method provides insight into the multiple imputation strategy
used in the ClustALL analysis pipeline:

This method is particularly useful for:
- Verifying whether imputation was performed on the dataset.
- Understanding the extent of the imputation process.
- Assessing the potential impact of imputation on subsequent analyses.
- Reporting the methodology used in handling missing data.
}
\note{
- This method returns the value stored in the 'nImputation' slot of the ClustAllObject.
- A return value of 0 does not necessarily mean the original data had no
  missing values; it could also indicate that imputation was explicitly skipped.
- The number of imputations is typically set during the creation of the
  ClustAllObject with the \code{\link{createClustAll}} function.
- For accessing the actual imputed datasets, use the \code{\link{dataImputed}} method.
