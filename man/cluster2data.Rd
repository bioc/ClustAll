\title{Export Stratification Results with Original Data}
\usage{
cluster2data(Object, stratificationName)
}
\arguments{
\item{Object}{A processed \code{\link{ClustAllObject-class}} object.
The object must have been processed by \code{\link{runClustAll}} before using
this function.}

\item{stratificationName}{A character vector specifying the names of one or more
stratifications to be exported. These names should correspond to stratifications
generated by the ClustALL algorithm and stored in the Object.}
}
\value{
A data.frame that includes the original data with additional column(s)
containing the selected stratification(s). Each selected stratification will
be added as a separate column to the original dataset.
}
\description{
This function combines the original input data with one or more selected
stratifications from the ClustALL algorithm results. It allows users to
examine how samples are clustered in the context of their original features,
facilitating further analysis and interpretation of the stratification
results.
}
\details{
The cluster2data function serves some important purposes in the ClustALL workflow:

1. Data Integration: It combines clustering results with the original feature data,
   allowing for comprehensive analysis of how cluster assignments relate to
   input variables.

2. Preparation for External Analysis: The resulting data frame can be easily
   exported for use in other analytical tools or visualization software.

The function is particularly useful for:
- Identifying features that distinguish different clusters
- Comparing how samples are grouped across different stratifications
- Preparing data for cluster-specific statistical analyses
- Creating visualizations that incorporate both cluster assignments and original features
}
\note{
- This function requires a processed ClustAllObject. Ensure \code{\link{runClustAll}}
  has been executed before using cluster2data.
- The stratificationName parameter accepts multiple stratification names, allowing
  for simultaneous export of multiple clustering solutions.
- Stratification names can be obtained from the results of \code{\link{resStratification}}
  or by examining the names in the summary_clusters slot of the ClustAllObject.
- The original data in the returned data frame includes all preprocessing steps
  applied during the creation of the ClustAllObject, such as one-hot encoding
  of categorical variables.
